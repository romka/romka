## Hello, everyone!

My name is Roman Arkharov and I'm a professional Software Engineer. Nowadays I mostly use in my work {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/java.png" "Java" >}}Java and related tools and frameworks, but during my career I had been working with all kinds of different technologies: {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/scala.ico" "Scala" >}}Scala, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/akka.ico" "Akka" >}}Akka, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/zio.png" "ZIO" >}}ZIO и {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/typelevel.png" "Cats" >}}Cats; {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/python.ico" "Python" >}}Python, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/django.png" "Django" >}}Django, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/twisted.ico" "Twisted" >}}Twisted; {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/php.png" "PHP" >}}PHP, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/symfony.png" "Symfony" >}}Symfony, {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/drupal.ico" "Drupal" >}}Drupal; and even with those already gone to the dustbin of history {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/flash.png" "Flash" >}}Flash + {{< inline-ico "/about/icons/actionscript.png" "ActionScript" >}}ActionScript 2 и 3. Oh, those were fun times.</p>

Biggest part of my life I lived in Moscow and the most interesting stages in my career were work in **Yandex** (2015-2021) and in the magazine **Forbes** (2010-2014). Now I live in Berlin and work in company **Snowflake**. 

In this blog I post notes and articles related to my work, travel and other interesting to me topics.
