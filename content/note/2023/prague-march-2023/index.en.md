We went to Prague with Olya for a couple of days, below are a few short notes from that trip.

### Transport
My first note is not about Czech Republic but about Germany. I probably won't stop marvelling soon enough at how terrible the railway works here. Got the direction of wagon numbering reversed? That's not even a problem. Except for the case when the train stops just a couple of minutes and you have to run from its tail to the head to get into your wagon. There's no wagon with the number on your ticket? Well, sometimes it happens, passengers will somehow sort it out. You have bought two tickets for the neighbouring seats, but the train with a different wagon arrived and now you are sitting across the aisle in four rows from each other. Who cares? 

### Cities
The second note is not about Prague, but about Berlin. Berlin is, without exaggeration, &mdash; the dirtiest city in Europe I've ever been to, whereas Prague, at least its centre, is one of the cleanest cities. In Berlin, you slowly get used to the trash, cigarette butts and other traces of human life scattered everywhere, but it is especially the contrast after you have travelled.

### Food

I spent [quite a lot of time in Prague]({{< relref "pervye-vpechatleniya-o-prage" >}}) in 2014 and 2017, therefore this time we didn't do much sightseeing (though, apparently, we went to Charles Bridge and Staroměstské náměstí) and mostly focused on the local cuisine. The most popular local meal &mdash; is a pork knee but its disadvantage is that it has almost the same taste everywhere. However, pork ribs have a specific authentic recipe in each restaurant. The top-1 pork ribs in my own rating are cooked in the restaurant [Lavička](https://www.restaurace-lavicka.cz). They are cooked in a honey sauce and served with horseradish, barbecue sauce and crispy croutons. Delicious caramelised crust, soft tender meat that separates easily from the bone... mmm... _ich mag das_. One should eat this meal oooonly with your hands, it's muuuch tastier in this way :)

First time I tasted these ribs in this place during my fist visit to Prague 9 years ago and since that time their taste haven't changed a bit. But it's the case when you don't want to have any changes.

Despite the fact that pork knees have relatively the same taste in all the places, here I also have my own favorite place from 2014, it's the restaurant [U Balbínů](https://www.ubalbinu.cz). Here they serve this meal with pickled onions and cucumbers. Pork meat, in my taste, is too fat and pickles create here a perfect balance: on the one hand suppress this sticky fatty taste left in your mouth by meat, on the other hand meat eliminates an acidity created by pickles, if you ate too much of them. The knee itself here usually is literally huge, it easily may weigh more than 1 kilogram, so, it's safe to take ot for two persons.

And, of course, talking about local food it's a crime not to mention a Wenceslas sausage &mdash; a hot-dog in which they use a chopped meat sausage instead of regular one. Yummy. Earlier, in 2015, in the Prague's downtown there were plenty of kiosks where such hot-dogs were served. These days for some reason they've been removed and you now can find Wenceslas sausages in a few small restaurants where this street food is sold for to go.

### Currency exchange
In 2014 in the Prague's downtown there were an obsenely large number of [currency exchange kiosks]({{< relref "novye-vpechatleniya-o-chehii" >}}) with predatory Euro to Czech Krone exchange rates. Now they also exists, but their number is reduced significantly, I've stumbled upon only 2 of those, where an exchange rate was about 16 Krones for 1 Euro whereas an official exchange rate is about 23. That fact that the number of such a scummy exchangers reduced is a big advantage, but tourists still have to be careful.

### Massage
In the Prague's downtown there are still a lot of Thai massage salons with prices starting from 9.99 Euros per session. I can't imagine what kind of service they provide for this price, highly unlikely anything valuable. Apart from such fishy salons you can find those where massage costs more or less adequate amount of money. For example, in 5 minutes by foot from the Wenceslas Square (in other words, in the heart of the city) an hour of good Thai oil-massage costs 1000-1200 Krones (50-60 Euros) and in the salon [Leela](http://www.leela.cz/), in 4-5 tram-stops from the downtown, 700-800 Krones. By the way, from the 2014 prices from the latest one remained almost the same.
