Once upon a time I wrote about [my experience interacting with the German Police](https://romka.eu/en/note/2024/supermoon/). Just recetly another episode has ended.

A couple of days ago, last Sunday, we found out, that my wife's bike was stolen from the locked bicycle room in the underground parking :( it's necessary to note, that the parking ccan be accessed only with the key; bicycle rooms are also locked and bikes are chained to the bicycle rack mounted to the floor.

In theory, everything is well secured :) but on practice: anyone can get into the parking through the open car gate, just following the car entering to the parking; neigbors are idiots, and they almost never lock the bicycle rooms (even now, when the crime has committed); and the bicycle rack can be just easily cut.

Both of our bicycles were chained to the same rack, but only my wife's bike was stolen. Probably, there were only one theft, and he couldn't take two bikes at once. But he was a bit unlucky: quite literally two weeks ago I installed AirTag under the seat of the Olga's bike! My bike didn't have the geotag!

At first we informed the Police about the crime, in Berlin it [can be easily done online](https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/index_121.html) and claimed an issue to the insurance company. Almost immediately we were called back from the Police, they asked a few questions and told us that tomorrow, on Monday, the Policeman will come to take a look at the crime scene.

Then we took a carsharing car and went to the place where, according to AirTag data, the bike was.

Honestly, I was sure, that thefts should be smart and informed enough, should be aware about such devices as geotags, should know where to seek for them, and should remove and throw them away right after steeling. Besides that, AirTags have one very sad limitation -- unwanted tracking protecion. In theory, AirTag can be discreetly planted to any person's bag to track his movements. It's forbidden by the rules and on the software level iPhone can inform its owner that he is being followed by the unregistered AirTag. That's why a thief, if he has iPhone, will be warned by his phone that he is traveling with the AirTag.

Long story short, I didn't hope for the success.

AirTag was located in Neukölln --- one of the dirties and uncomfortable districts of the city. A lot of fishy people are scattered around there. Yes, I know that a crime doesn't have nationality, but by some reason, I'm not surprised, that the bike appeared here, but not, let's say, in Mitte or Pankow.

Approximately within the radius of the geotag we found a suspicious second hand bikes shop. I'm still sure, that this shop is related to the crime, since the bike stayed there for almost two days, until Tuesday. The shop was closed, we tried to find an entrance to the shop's yard, bu without luck. We gave up and went back home.

On the very next day, on Monday, the geotag started moving within the district, we again cought a carsharing car and raced to Neukölln. This time tha tag was about 100 meters away from the yesterday's place, in the yard of another building. It's necessary to mention, that in Berlin there are a lot of houses with closed yards that cannot be accessed from the street without a key. Getting to such yards at's a not easy quest. Especially, taking into account the fact that we didn't know in which exact yard should we get in. We were able to check three of them.

To enter the yard we were calling to all the apartmens, tried to explain what happened and ask to let us in. To the first yard some one open athe door for us without any problems, in the second one the door was just open and to the third one no one wanted to let us in... In general, I unedrstand why: when you live in such a butthole it's too risky to open the door for strangers.

Unfortunately, all of these adventures didn't give any outcome. At the last yard we were close to the geotag, but there were no bike. But there were a dumpsite. I almost convinced myself, that the tag was just removed and thrown away to the trash.

For the second time we had to give up and return back home without success.

And then Tuesday came and the action bagan. The Police called to Olya and asked for the geotag coordinates. But while they were driving to that place the bike's location changed and they called her for the second time... and then for the third... On the fifth call they proposed her to come to the point and help with searching the bike.
