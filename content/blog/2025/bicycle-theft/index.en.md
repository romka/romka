I’ve already written about [my experience with the German Police](https://romka.eu/en/note/2024/supermoon/). Just recently another episode came to the end.

A couple of days ago, last Sunday, we found out that Olya's bike was stolen from the locked bicycle room in the underground parking :( it's worth noting, that the parking can be accessed only with the key; bicycle rooms are also locked and bikes are chained to floor-mounted bike-racks.

In theory, everything is pretty well secured :) but in practice: anyone can get into the parking through the opened car gate, just following the car entering the parking; neigbors are idiots, and they almost never lock the bicycle rooms (even now, after the theft); and the bicycle rack was just sawed through by the thief.

Both of our bicycles were chained to the same rack, but only Olya's bike was stolen. Probably, there was just one thief, and he couldn't carry off both. But he was a bit unlucky: quite literally two weeks ago I installed AirTag under the seat of Olya's bike! My bike didn't have the geotracker!

First, we reported the crime to the police --- in Berlin it [can be easily done online](https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/index_121.html), and filed a claim with an insurance company. Almost immediately we were called back from the police, they asked a few questions and told us that tomorrow, on Monday, the officer would come to take a look at the crime scene.

Then we grabbed a carsharing car and drove to the place where the AirTag shown the bike was.

Honestly, I was assumed, that thieves should be smart and informed enough, should be aware about such devices as geotags, should know where to seek for them, and should remove and throw them away right after stealing. Besides that, AirTags have one very frustrating limitation -- unwanted tracking detection. In theory, AirTag can be discreetly planted to someones's bag to track their movements. It's forbidden by the rules and on the software level iPhone can inform its owner that he is being followed by the unregistered AirTag. That's why a thief, if he has iPhone, would've been warned that he is traveling with the unregistered AirTag.

Long story short, I didn't hope for the success.

AirTag was located in Neukölln --- one of the dirties and uncomfortable districts in the city. A lot of shady-looking characters are hanging around there. Yes, I know that crime has no nationality, but by some reason, I'm not surprised, that the bike ended up here, but not, let's say, in Mitte or Pankow.

Within the AirTag’s signal radius, we found a suspicious secondhand bikes shop. I'm still sure, that this shop is related to the crime, since the bike stayed there for almost two days, until Tuesday. The shop was closed, we tried to find an entrance to the courtyard behind it, but no luck. Finally, we gave up and went back home.

The very next day, on Monday, the AirTag started moving around the district, we again grabbed another carsharing car and rushed back to Neukölln. This time, the tag was about 100 meters away from the yesterday's place, in the courtyard of another building. It's necessary to mention, that in Berlin there are a lot of houses with closed courtyards that cannot be accessed from the street without a key. So, Getting to one is a bit of adventure. Especially, taking into account the fact that we didn't know in which exact courtyard should we get in. We were able to check three of them.

To get in we buzzed to random apartments, tried to explain what happened and ask to let us in. To the first yard someone open the door for us without any problems, in the second one the door was just open and to the third one no one wanted to let us in... In general, I understand why: when you live in such a butthole it's too risky to open the door for strangers.

Unfortunately, all of these little adventures led nowhere. At the last courtyard we were close to the geotracker, but there were no bike. However, there were a trash pile --- and I almost convinced myself, that the tag was just dismounted from the bike and thrown away to the trash.

So, for the second time we had to give up and return back home empty-handed.

Then Tuesday came — and that’s when the action started. The police called Olya and asked for the geotracker coordinates. But while they were driving to that place the bike's location changed, and they called her for the second time... and then for the third... On the fifth call they proposed her to come to the area and help with searching the bike.

The whole scene looked like something out of an action movie about spies and special services: a city street, music, increasing mystery and dynamism. On the street, five plainclothes officers are trying to blend into the background to avoid drawing attention to themselves. In doing so, they are also trying to find the missing bicycle. One of them spotted Olya. With a quick professional glance, he recognised her as the bike's owner. With a "phone receiver at his ear" gesture, he asked if he was talking to her on the phone? A brief nod. And now the teammates are together, shoulder to shoulder, walking down the street and using the FindMy app to search for the missing artifact. Eventually the app led the heroes to a parked car with a bicycle in it! Now the agents set up an ambush and began waiting for the culprit.

After about an hour of waiting, the car owner shown up. It was an about fifty years old man. I'm not gonna tell his nationality, since the crime doesn't have it, but we do remember which part of the city this is all happening in.

The man assured that he just today bought this bike for 100 Euros and ready to return it right now. Honestly, it's hard to believe. I already told, that to steal the bike, the thief cut the bike rack, to which the bike was chained. The chain was still hanging on the bike's frame! How on Earth this idiot could buy a bike without asking how to unlock the chain? Beyond that, in Germany even cheapest Decathlon-bike costs starting from 300 Euros. What the porridge instead of brain man should have to buy this bike for one hundred? For the record, it costs 700. So yeah — it’s painfully obvious this asshole knew that he's buying a stolen thing.

And apparently, I underestimated human's stupidity and overestimated thief's professionalism. Man, you steal a bike and don't even try to check for trackers? Real genius right there.

In the dry balance, the bike was found and returned in just two days. To some, but to me, it's a great job.
